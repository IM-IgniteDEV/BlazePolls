## üõ† Commands & Permissions

Durations support unit-suffixed tokens:  
`d = days, h = hours, m = minutes, s = seconds`  
Bare numbers are treated as minutes.

**Examples:**
- `10m` = 10 minutes
- `1h30m` = 1 hour 30 minutes

## Messages and GUIs use placeholders:  
`{id}`, `{question}`, `{created}`, `{duration}`, `{index}`, `{option}`, `{votes}`

- Each poll is saved as JSON in the plugin data folder
- Powered by SimpleJSONConfig service
